## Project Summary
<b>• About the project:</b>
This project is a web-based application that helps users plan their solar power usage and estimate the duration of power backup during the monsoon season. It allows users to input their daily appliance usage, calculates the total energy consumption, and provides optimization suggestions to extend the power backup duration. The project aims to assist users in making informed decisions about their energy usage and maximize the benefits of solar power systems.

• <b>Skills and Technology used:</b>
The project utilizes web development technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

• <b>Impact on Real-world problem solving:</b>
This project addresses the real-world problem of optimizing power usage and planning for power backup during the monsoon season. By allowing users to input their daily appliance usage, the project helps them understand their energy consumption patterns and make informed decisions to reduce usage and extend the duration of power backup. The optimization suggestions provided by the project encourage users to adopt energy-saving practices, leading to reduced energy consumption, lower electricity bills, and a more efficient use of solar power systems. Ultimately, this project contributes to sustainable energy usage and supports the transition towards clean and renewable energy sources.
